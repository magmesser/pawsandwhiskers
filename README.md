  ## Description
  🔮 This application serves as a pet adoption website for prospective pet owners to browse available cats and dogs.  We wanted to provide an interactive application for users to view a gallery of all pets, view by only cats and only dogs, and a single detailed view of each pet. 

  ### Elevator Pitch 
  Our team can offer your nonprofit organization a clean looking website that showcases the dogs or cats you have up for adoption. Your clients will be able to get the information they need on your available pets as well as see a picture of their newest furry friend. Your staff will easily be able to add new pets to the website as your shelter continues to do the wonderful work of rescuing these pets.

  ### User Story
    AS A pet shelter owner
    I WANT to be able to upload cats and dogs in need of homes and delete adopted pets
    SO THAT prospective pet owners can chose a pet to adopt.
